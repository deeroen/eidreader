=========================
The ``eidreader`` package
=========================




eidreader is a tool to read data from Belgian eID cards that are inserted into a
local SD card reader. It is designed to be used together with a web application.

eidreader 1.x was a command-line script to be executed each time you wanted to
read a card. eidreader 2.x is a long-running daemon process that continuously
polls the card reader and posts the data to a constant URL.

Not to be mixed up with its deprecated Java predecessor `eidreader
<https://github.com/lsaffre/eidreader>`__ (same project name but another
account).
